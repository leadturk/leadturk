      <h1 class="mt-5">Imagine a steady flow of leads from LinkedIn.</h1>

      <div class="problem text-center mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-5 pt-5">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          When we discovered that LinkedIn was super valuable for getting leads and customers, we decided to put all our efforts in it and use it to connect with potential customers for our business.
          <br/><br/>
          As we have technical backgrounds, we jumped in like crazy and tried to automate the process of connecting with people and sending out messages. But we were quick to find out that LinkedIn was made for real people and was working hard to prevent all the automatic bots.
          <br/><br/>
          We found out the painful way that bots and automation tools are a sure way to get yourself blocked or at least restricted :|
          <br/><br/>
          After making a lot of mistakes and learning LinkedIn’s Do’s and Don’ts by heart, we suddenly realized we had some valuable experiences that other professionals could benefit from.

      <div class="solution text-center mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-5 pt-5">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          LinkedIn allows us to work with an assistant which makes complete sense since no valuable professional or CEO would be willing to spend time on this, and since the person who works is a real human, and not a bot.
          <br/><br/>
          We started doing everything non-automated the results were amazing. We made 800+ connections within a month, we spoke with 8 potential customers and we even made some new friends along the way.
          <br/><br/>
          Then we thought we could start forming a team of people to work together and help us do the repetitive work of connecting and sending out messages. And all this is perfectly fine with LinkedIn! There were no bots and tools involved.
