      <h1 class="my-5">Imagine a steady flow of leads from LinkedIn.</h1>

      <div class="problem text-center mb-5">
        <p class="lead">
          When we discovered that <strong>LinkedIn</strong> was super valuable for <strong>getting leads</strong> and <strong>customers</strong>, we decided to put all our efforts in it and use it to connect with potential customers for our business.
          <br/><br/>
          As we both have <strong>technical backgrounds</strong>, we jumped in immediately and tried to automate the process of connecting with people and sending out messages. But we were quick to find out that LinkedIn was made for <strong>real people</strong> and was working hard to prevent all the automatic bots.
          <br/><br/>
          We found out the painful way that bots and automation tools are a <strong>sure way</strong> to get yourself <strong>blocked</strong> or at least restricted.
          <br/><br/>
          The other show stopper we ran into was the fact that this process was plain <strong>boring and demotivating</strong>. Clicking through LinkedIn for hours in an attempt to find that one person who you’ll eventually have a conversation with, was the kind of patience, determination and continuity we don’t have. This is a summary of everything we needed but didn’t possess, that almost made us give up:
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            <br/><strong>Thick skin (Why wouldn’t they accept my request)?</strong><br/>
            <br/><strong>Patience (Results come with time)</strong><br/>
            <br/><strong>Determination (Don’t give up after 80 rejections)</strong><br/>
            <br/><strong>Consistency (An hour or two every day)</strong><br/>
            <br/><strong>Self discipline (Stop after max 100 requests per day)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lead mt-5">
        So after making a lot of mistakes and learning LinkedIn’s Do’s and Don’ts by heart, we suddenly realized we had the <strong>super valuable experience</strong> of trial and error that other professionals could benefit from.
        </p>

      <div class="solution text-center mb-5">
        <h2 class="mb-5 pt-5">The Solution</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          LinkedIn allows us to work with an assistant which makes complete sense since no valuable professional or CEO would be willing to spend time on this, and since the person who works is a real human, and not a bot.
          <br/><br/>
          We started doing everything non-automated the results were amazing. We made 800+ connections within a month, we spoke with 8 potential customers and we even made some new friends along the way.
          <br/><br/>
          Then we thought we could start forming a team of people to work together and help us do the repetitive work of connecting and sending out messages. And all this is perfectly fine with LinkedIn! There were no bots and tools involved.
